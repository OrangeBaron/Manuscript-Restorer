# ✨ Manuscript Restorer
### Digital Restoration Tool for Historical Documents

This tool allows researchers, archivists, and enthusiasts to restore the legibility of ancient manuscripts affected by fading ink, yellowing paper, or stains. It uses computer vision techniques (adaptive thresholding, high-pass filtering) to enhance contrast without destroying the original texture.
